# Human-Capital-Management-System
## Project Description:
The Human Capital Management System (HCMS) is an advanced J2EE-based application designed to streamline and automate the human resource functions within an organization. This comprehensive system is tailored to meet the needs of various functional departments including HR, training, and requirements management.
### Technologies Used:
#### Java EE: 
The core of the application is built using Java EE (Java Platform, Enterprise Edition) to leverage its robust, scalable, and secure framework.
#### JSP (JavaServer Pages): 
JSP is used for building dynamic web pages, allowing seamless interaction between the front-end and back-end.
#### Servlets: 
Servlets are employed to handle the server-side logic, managing client requests, and responses effectively.
#### HTML & CSS: 
These are used for designing and styling the user interface, ensuring a user-friendly and responsive design.
#### MySQL: 
MySQL serves as the relational database management system (RDBMS), providing a reliable and efficient way to store and manage data.
#### Hibernate: 
Hibernate is used for Object-Relational Mapping (ORM), simplifying database interactions and ensuring smooth data persistence.
#### JavaBeans: 
JavaBeans are utilized to encapsulate the application's data and business logic, promoting reusability and modularity.
#### JDBC (Java Database Connectivity): 
JDBC is implemented for connecting and executing SQL queries to interact with the MySQL database.
#### Apache Tomcat: 
Apache Tomcat is the web server and servlet container used for deploying and running the application
